## Process of creating articles, feature test and feature

- create a feature branch
- Write feature test
- Build features to make test pass one by one
- refactor and check syntax with rubocop
- check pending tests with Spec coverage
- check code smell and OOP design with reek
- Once all tests are green, spec coverage close to 100% and we are happy about our OOD ask for code review if it's possible and when it's fine, merge to master.
